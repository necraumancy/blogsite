                <b>About me</b><br>
                <i>Last updated: 15 Mar 2025</i><br><br>
                
                My name is raum, I’m 22 years of age. I’m nonbinary and use it/its pronouns.<br>I despise social media so this is my own little island. I have many interests, which ultimately comprise of music, video games, and my own ocs.<br><br>
                
                I have a girlfriend of 5 years whom I love with my whole heart. We have been long distance the entire time but I’m working hard to be able to see her. I spend much of my time in the same routines. I graduated with a degree in computer science in 2024 and am now employed.<br><br>
                
                I dread adulthood, yet I yearn for the freedom it may bring me. I dislike my current living situation and wish so badly it was different.<br><br>
                
                My favorite games! - Doom, Overwatch, TF2, Quake, The Binding of Isaac.. + more<br>
                I'm a Master 3 support and Diamond 2 tank in overwatch!<br>
                I love FPS games, especially older ones.<br><br>
